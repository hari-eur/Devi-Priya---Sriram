write a c prog for a simple calculator. 
a) Program should get two decimal inputs A & B from user.
b) Define separate functions for below operations and print the results in main()
c) Make sure the functions don't alter the input arguments.
  c.1)  Add A & B,
  c.2)  SUB A & B, 
  c.3)  Multiply A & B,
  c.4)  Divide A & B (results can be decimal),
  c.4)  Increment A & B by 1,
  c.5)  Decrement A & B by 1, 
  c.6)  Print largest number of A & B.
  c.7)  Check if A & B are equal.
  c.8)  print A & B in Hex.
  c.9)  Double the inut A without using arithemetic operators and print.
  c.10)  Print left most nibble of A & 6th bit of B.
d) Track the total num of functions calls done and print.
  d.1) Use global variable, increment it inside function and print at end of the main().
e) Track the num of time each function is called and print it inside the function on each call
